# TubeArchivist-Scanner-for-Plex
Scanner for Plex that allows TubeArchivist to integrate.

Heavily influenced by [Zero QI's Absolute Series Scanner](https://github.com/ZeroQI/Absolute-Series-Scanner) and [BeefTornado's Plex Custom Media Scanner](https://github.com/beeftornado/plex-custom-media-scanner), this project creates an integration path for [TubeArchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist) to integrate with Plex Media Server.

This is currently a work-in-progress and is not ready for use. Anyone willing to help with the project (development or testing) is encouraged to do so.
